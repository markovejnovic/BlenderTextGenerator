## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
This project is built on top of `python 2`, `PyGTK`, `pygtkglext` and 
`Blender`. Those are the necessary dependencies.

### Installing

It's as easy as:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/markovejnovic/BlenderTextGenerator.git
cd BlenderTextGenerator
python setup.py
```
You now have an installation of BlenderTextGenerator and can run it by:
```bash
BlenderTextGenerator
```

### Development installation

Just clone it and feel free to contribute!

## Running the tests
At the moment there are no unit tests. That is something that we plan on 
fixing in the near future.
